# Title:        Preprocessing Gradebook data ####
# Project:      132 n-TARP Profiles

# 
# Description:  The gradebook data is in a very customized and nonstandard format in an Excel file. This script pulls all of the gradebook data together and cleans it, focusing on midterm and final grades.
# 
# Package dependencies: 
# 
# Input stack: 
#     Gradebook (raw, original)       
#       For example, `ENGR132_Sp18_SemesterGrades_v5_deID.xlsx`
#     CLEANED GRADEBOOK file (Excel)
#       For example, `ENGR132_Sp18_SemesterGrades_v5_deID-3_min_title_meta.xlsx`
#       Modifications from the original raw gradebook are:
#         -remove header information on each of the section sheets, delete first five rows; 
#         -remove unique column IDs from the end of each column, search and replace ` |*` with ``, about 2400 replacements; 
#         -remove point value details from the end of each column, search and replace ` [*` with ``, also about 2400 replacements across the 14 sections; 
#         -delete summary sheets, all sheets that are not raw section data.
#
# Changelog:
#     
#                   
# Feature wish list:  (*: planned but not complete)
#     *2021.03.30.  I would like to pull the reflection data out of this workbook.  The entries seem to be in columns FI - FW

  ### Attempting to clean the gradebook column names from the original data file. I could not get this to work, so I did some cleaning externally in Excel before proceeding. What I did is described in the script header
  # gsub(x = colnames(grades), 
  #      pattern = "^.*(?=|)",
  #      perl = TRUE)
  # str_view(string = colnames(grades), 
  #      pattern = "^.*(?=[|])")
  
  
  #load the early columns of the gradebook (Sections 2â€”14)
  for (i in 2:14) {
    temp_grades <- read_xlsx(path = filenameGB, 
                             sheet = i,
                             col_names = gradebook_names, 
                             col_types = "text",
                             skip = 0,
                             range = cell_cols("D:T"))
    
    # remove unneeded and/or problematic columns
    temp_grades <-  temp_grades %>% 
      select(gradebook_names[c(1,3,6,7,9,11:17)])
                                    
    # append the current section's data to the main collection
    grades <- grades %>% bind_rows(temp_grades)
    
    # # Get a preview of column names
    # ### Using the following, I discovered some inconsistencies in how the problems were named. Hence why I used the column names from section 1 in the preceding command
    # print(i)
    # print(names(read_xlsx(path = filenameGB, 
    #                 sheet = i,
